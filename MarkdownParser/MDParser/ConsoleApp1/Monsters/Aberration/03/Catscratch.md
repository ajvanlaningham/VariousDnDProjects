- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A felid or feline humanoid that fails this saving throw contracts catscratch fugue.

- **Claws**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage.

- **Vomit (Recharge 5-6)**: The catscratch vomits poisonous bile in a 15-foot cone.

A felid or feline humanoid that fails this saving throw contracts catscratch fugue.
