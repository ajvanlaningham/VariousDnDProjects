### Abilities
 --- 
- **Healing Oil**: A bagiennik can automatically stabilize a dying creature by using an action to smear some of its oily secretion on the dying creature's flesh. A similar application on an already-stable creature or one with 1 or more hit points acts as a potion of healing, restoring 2d4 + 2 hit points. Alternatively, the bagiennik's secretion can have the effect of a lesser restoration spell. However, any creature receiving a bagiennik's Healing Oil must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be slowed for 1 minute.

### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The bagiennik makes two claw attacks.

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d6 + 4) slashing damage.

- **Acid Spray**: Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 15 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) acid damage. The target must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone in the slick oil, which covers an area 5 feet square. A creature that enters the oily area or ends its turn there must also make the Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling prone. A creature needs to make only one saving throw per 5-foot-square per turn, even if it enters and ends its turn in the area. The slippery effect lasts for 3 rounds.
