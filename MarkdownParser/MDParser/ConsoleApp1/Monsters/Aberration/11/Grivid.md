- **Parasitic Cheek Worm**: Produces parasitic worms in its cheeks and it expels these worms into other creatures when it attacks. Worm burrows into target's flesh and that creature is poisoned while infested with at least one worm. At start of each of infested creature’s turns it takes 5 (2d4) poison.
