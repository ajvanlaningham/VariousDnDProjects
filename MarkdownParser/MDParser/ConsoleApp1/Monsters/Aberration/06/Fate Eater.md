- **Spectral Bite**: when a fate eater scores a critical hit against a target, it damages not only the creature but also the threads of its fate, changing the character's past or future. The target must roll 1d6 on the chart below for each critical hit that isn't negated by a successful DC 15 Charisma saving throw:1- Seeing the Alternates: Suffers the effects of the confusion spell for 1d4 rounds2- Untied from the Loom: Character's speed is randomized for four rounds. Roll 3d20 at the start of each of the character's turns to determine his or her speed in feet that turn3- Shifting Memories: Permanently loses 2 from a random skill and gains 2 in a random untrained skill4- Not So Fast: Loses the use of one class ability, chosen at random5- Lost Potential: Loses 1 point from one randomly chosen ability score6- Took the Lesser Path: The character's current hit point total becomes his or her hit point maximum effects 3-6 are permanent until the character makes a successful Charisma saving throw. The saving throw is repeated after every long rest, but the DC increases by 1 after every long rest, as the character becomes more entrenched in this new destiny. Otherwise, these new fates can be undone by nothing short of a wish spell or comparable magic.
