- **Chaos Pheromones**: The khalkos emits a cloud of pheromones in a 20-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners. Each non-khalkos creature in the area makes a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw. Creatures with an alignment trait make this save with disadvantage. On a failure  the creature is confused for 1 minute.
