## Dimensional Shambler
*(Large) (Aberration) *

**Armor Class:** 16
**Hit Points:** 102 (12d10+36)
**Speed:** {"walk": 30}

**Initiative:** 21
**Proficiency Bonus:**
**Challenge:** 9

**Languages:** Abyssal, Infernal, Void Speech

### Abilities
 --- 
- **Look Between**: As a bonus action, the dimensional shambler can see 60 feet into any of the Lower Planes when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa. This sight lasts until the beginning of its next turn. During this time, the dimensional shambler is deaf and blind with regard to its own senses in its current plane.

- **Maddening Form**: When a creature that can see the dimensional shambler starts its turn within 30 feet of the dimensional shambler, the dimensional shambler can force it to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw if the dimensional shambler is not incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. If the creature is concentrating on a spell, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on the spell.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the dimensional shambler until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dimensional shambler in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw.

- **Step Between**: As a bonus action, the dimensional shambler can magically shift from the Material Plane to any Lower Plane, or vice versa. It can’t bring other creatures with it when it shifts in this way.
