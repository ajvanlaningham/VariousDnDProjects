- **Consume Self**: A living wick can be commanded to rapidly burn through the remains of its wick, creating a devastating fireball. All creatures within 20 feet of the living wick take 7 (2d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. The wick is reduced to a lifeless puddle of wax.
