### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The algorith makes two logic razor attacks.

- **Logic Razor**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (4d12 + 5) force damage.

- **Cone of Negation (Recharge 5-6)**: An algorith can project a cone of null energy. Targets inside the 30 foot cone take 42 (12d6) force damage and suffer the effect of a dispel magic spell. A successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage to half and negates the dispel magic effect on that target.

- **Reality Bomb (5/Day)**: The algorith can summon forth a tiny rune of law and throw it as a weapon. Any creature within 30 feet of the square where the reality bomb lands takes 21 (6d6) force damage and is stunned until the start of the algorith's next turn. A target that makes a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw takes half damage and isn't stunned.
