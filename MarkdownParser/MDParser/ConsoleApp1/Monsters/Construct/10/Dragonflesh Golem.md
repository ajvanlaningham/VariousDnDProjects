### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The dragonflesh golem uses Terror Stare. It then makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.

- **Claws**: Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d6 + 6) slashing damage.

- **Terror Stare**: The dragonflesh golem chooses a creature that can see its eyes within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the golem’s Terror Stare for the next 24 hours.

- **Elemental Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragonflesh golem exhales energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage and 21 (6d6) damage of another type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Roll a d4 to determine the additional damage type: 1 is acid, 2 is cold, 3 is lightning, and 4 is poison.
