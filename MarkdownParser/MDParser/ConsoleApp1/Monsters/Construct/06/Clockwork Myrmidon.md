- **Slam**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

- **Alchemical Flame Jet (Recharge 5-6)**: The clockwork myrmidon can spew a jet of alchemical fire in a line 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Any creature in the path of the jet takes 26 (4d12) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The clockwork myrmidon can use this attack four times before its internal reservoir is emptied.

- **Grease Spray (Recharge 5-6)**: As a bonus action, the clockwork myrmidon's chest can fire a spray of alchemical grease with a range of 30 feet, covering a 10-by-10 foot square area and turning it into difficult terrain. Each creature standing in the affected area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. The clockwork myrmidon can use this attack four times before its internal reservoir is emptied.

- **Alchemical Fireball**: The clockwork myrmidon's alchemical flame reservoir explodes when the construct is destroyed, spraying nearby creatures with burning fuel. A creature within 5 feet of the myrmidon takes 19 (3d12) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. This explosion doesn't occur if the clockwork myrmidon has already fired its alchemical flame jet four times.
