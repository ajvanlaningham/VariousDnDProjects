- **Deafening Clatter**: A creature in the swarm’s space is deafened.

- **False Appearance**: While the greed swarm remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal pile of coins and valuables.

- **Coin Slam**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the greed swarm’s space. Hit: 10 (4d4) bludgeoning damage, or 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

- **Coin Barrage**: Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

- **Gather (1/Day)**: The swarm magically gathers up to 100 gp worth of coins, gems, and other small, valuable objects within 60 feet of it, adding them to its mass. It regains 7 (2d6) hit points and has advantage on its next attack roll. A creature wearing or carrying such valuables must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or its valuables fly toward the swarm, joining the mass.
