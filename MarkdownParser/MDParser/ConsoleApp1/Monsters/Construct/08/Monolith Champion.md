### Abilities
 --- 
- **Blatant Dismissal**: While in a fey court or castle, a monolith champion that scores a successful hit with its greatsword can try to force the substitution of the target with a shadow double. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or become invisible, silent, and paralyzed, while an illusory version of itself remains visible and audible-and under the monolith champion's control, shouting for a retreat or the like. Outside fey locales, this ability does not function.

- **Fey Flame**: The ritual powering a monolith champion grants it an inner flame that it can use to enhance its weapon or its fists with additional fire or cold damage, depending on the construct's needs.
