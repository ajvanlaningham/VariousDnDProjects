### Abilities
 --- 
- **Dynastic Aura**: A creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the ushabti must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, unless the ushabti is incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature has its breath stolen; it takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage, and until the end of the ushabti's next turn, can't cast spells that require a verbal component or speak louder than a whisper. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to this ushabti's Dynastic Aura for the next 24 hours.

- **Healing Leech**: If a creature within 30 feet of the ushabti regains hit points from a spell or a magical effect, the creature gains only half the normal number of hit points and the ushabti gains the other half.

- **Immutable Form**: The ushabti is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

- **Magic Resistance**: The ushabti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

- **Magic Weapons**: The ushabti's weapon attacks are magical.
