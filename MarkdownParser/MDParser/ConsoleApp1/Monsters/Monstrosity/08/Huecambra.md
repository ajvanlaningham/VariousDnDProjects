### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The huecambra makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its claw, and one with its tail.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become cursed. While cursed, the creature grows gem-like growths across its body. When the cursed creature takes damage that isn’t poison or psychic, it and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) thunder damage. This damage doesn’t trigger further explosions. The curse lasts until it is lifted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage.

- **Tail**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

- **Gem Explosion (Recharge 6)**: The huecambra causes some of the gem-like nodules on its body to detonate. Each creature within 20 feet of the huecambra must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 24 (7d6) thunder damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned. A creature cursed by the huecambra’s bite has disadvantage on this saving throw.
