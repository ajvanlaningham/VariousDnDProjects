### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The tosculi warrior makes one bite attack, one claws attack, and one stinger attack.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage.

- **Claws**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage.

- **Stinger**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against poison or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

- **Prepare Host**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one paralyzed creature. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) piercing damage, and the target is paralyzed for 8 hours. The paralysis can be ended with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check or by a spell or magical effect that cures disease. (Because only paralyzed creatures can be targeted, a hit by this attack is automatically a critical hit; bonus damage is included in the damage listing.)
