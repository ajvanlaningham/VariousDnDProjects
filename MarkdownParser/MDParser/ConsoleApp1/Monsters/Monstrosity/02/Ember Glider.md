### Abilities
 --- 
- **Fiery Nature**: Is infused with elemental power and it requires only half the amount of air food and drink that a typical Monstrosity of its size needs.

- **Glide**: Has membranes between its fore and hind limbs that expand while falling to slow its rate of descent to 60' per round landing on its feet and taking no falling damage. It can move up to 5 ft. horizontally for every 1' it falls. Can’t gain height with its gliding membranes alone. If subject to a strong wind or lift of any kind can use updraft to glide farther.

- **Glow**: Sheds dim light in a 10 ft. radius.

- **Heated Body**: A creature that touches the ember glider or hits it with melee attack while within 5 ft. of it takes 4 (1d8) fire.

- **Keen Smell**: Advantage: smell Wis (Percept) checks.
