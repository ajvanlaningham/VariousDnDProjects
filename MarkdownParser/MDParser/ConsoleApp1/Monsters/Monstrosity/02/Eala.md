### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The eala makes two attacks with its wing blades.

- **Wing Blades**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

- **Fire Breath (recharge 5-6)**: The eala breathes fire in a 20-foot cone. Every creature in the area must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. The eala's fire breath ignites flammable objects and melts soft metals in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Swan Song**: When the eala is reduced to 0 hit points, it can use its last breath sing a plaintive and beautiful melody. Creatures within 20 feet that can hear the eala must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 round. A creature incapacitated in this way has its speed reduced to 0.
