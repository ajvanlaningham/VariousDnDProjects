### Abilities
 --- 
- **Multiple Heads**: The chameleon hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious. Whenever the chameleon hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the chameleon hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.

- **Superior Camouflage**: While the chameleon hydra remains motionless, it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, the chameleon hydra can hide even while a creature can see it.

- **Wakeful**: While the chameleon hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.
