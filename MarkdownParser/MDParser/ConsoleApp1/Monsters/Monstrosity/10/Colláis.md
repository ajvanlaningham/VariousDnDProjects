### Actions

- **Multiattack**: The colláis makes one gore attack and two hooves attacks.

- **Gore**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

- **Hooves**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

- **Cry of the Forest**: The colláis sounds a dreadful and reverberating call. Each creature within 100 feet of the colláis that can hear the cry must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the colláis’s Cry of the Forest for the next 24 hours. Forest-dwelling beasts and monstrosities with an Intelligence of 4 or lower automatically succeed or fail on this saving throw, the colláis’s choice.
