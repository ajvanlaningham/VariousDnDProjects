### Abilities
 --- 
- **Corrosive Mold**: A creature that starts its turn grappled by the kirikari must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) acid damage.

- **Misty Veil**: The kirikari emits a light fog within 30 feet of itself. The mist moves with the kirikari, lightly obscuring the area around it. If dispersed by a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour), the mist reappears at the start of the kirikari’s next turn.

- **Unseen Attacker**: On each of its turns, the kirikari can use a bonus action to take the Hide action. If the kirikari is hidden from a creature and hits it with an attack, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage from the attack.

### Actions

- **Multiattack**: The kirikari makes two slam attacks.

- **Slam**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (4d12 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the kirikari can’t bite another target.

- **Blinding Veil (Recharge 5-6)**: The kirikari expels a cloud of intensified mist, heavily obscuring everything within 30 feet of it. The mist thins back to lightly obscuring the area at the end of the kirikari’s next turn.
