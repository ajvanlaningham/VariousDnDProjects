### Abilities
 --- 
- **Petrifying Gaze**: When a creature starts its turn within 60 feet of the medusa and can see the medusas eyes, it can choose to shut its eyes until the beginning of its next turn unless it is surprised or incapacitated. Otherwise, the medusa uses its petrifying gaze on the creature. If the medusa sees its own reflection and doesnt shut its eyes, it is subject to its own gaze.

- **A creature subject to the medusas petrifying gaze makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw**: If it rolls a natural 1 on the save, it is petrified instantly. If it otherwise fails the save, it is restrained as it begins to be petrified. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success and becoming petrified on a failure. The petrification can be removed with greater restoration or similar powerful magic.
