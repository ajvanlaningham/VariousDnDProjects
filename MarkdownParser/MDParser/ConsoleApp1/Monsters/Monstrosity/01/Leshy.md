### Abilities
 --- 
- **Innate Spellcasting**: the leshy's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: animal friendship, pass without trace, speak with animals

1/day each: entangle, plant growth, shillelagh, speak with plants, hideous laughter

- **Camouflage**: A leshy has advantage on Stealth checks if it is at least lightly obscured by foliage.

- **Mimicry**: A leshy can mimic the calls and voices of any creature it has heard. To use this ability, the leshy makes a Charisma (Deception) check. Listeners who succeed on an opposed Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Nature)-DM's choice-realize that something is mimicking the sound. The leshy has advantage on the check if it's mimicking a general type of creature (a crow's call, a bear's roar) and not a specific individual's voice.
