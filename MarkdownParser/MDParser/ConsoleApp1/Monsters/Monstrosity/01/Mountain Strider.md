### Abilities
 --- 
- **Charge**: If the mountain strider moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a headbutt attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the mountain strider and knocked prone.

- **Sure-Footed**: The mountain strider has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.

- **Thunderous Bleat (Recharge 6)**: The mountain strider releases a loud bleat in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Revenge for the Fallen**: When an ally the mountain strider can see is reduced to 0 hp within 30 feet of the mountain strider, the strider can move up to half its speed and make a headbutt attack.
