### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: One Beak attack and two Claws attacks.

- **Beak**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 8 (1d8+4) piercing damage.

- **Claws**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage.

- **Piercing Roll (Recharge 4–6)**: Tucks in its head and throws itself spikes first into nearby foes. Alke moves up to 25 ft. in a straight line and can move through space of any Med or smaller creature. The first time it enters a creature’s space during this move creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and 14 (4d6) piercing damage and is knocked prone (DC 15 Str half not knocked prone.)

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Repelling Spikes**: Adds 3 to its AC vs. one melee or ranged weapon attack that would hit it. To do so the alke must see the attacker and not be prone.
