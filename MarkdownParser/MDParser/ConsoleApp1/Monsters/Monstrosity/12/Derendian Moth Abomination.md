### Abilities

- **Antennae**: The Derendian moth abomination has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

- **Assimilation**: The Derendian moth abomination has six tentacles. Whenever it takes 30 or more damage in a single turn, one of its tentacles is shorn from its body. Whenever a non-undead creature drops to 0 hit points within 200 feet of the Derendian moth abomination, it can use its reaction to sprout one additional tentacle, up to a maximum of ten. Additional tentacles atrophy after one day.

- **Unbound**: The Derendian moth abomination’s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the moth’s speed nor cause it to be paralyzed or restrained.
