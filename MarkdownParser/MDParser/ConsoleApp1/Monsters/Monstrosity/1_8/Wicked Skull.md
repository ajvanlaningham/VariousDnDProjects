### Abilities
 --- 
- **False Appearance (Object Form Only)**: While the wicked skull remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.

- **Jokester**: The wicked skull has advantage on a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check if it includes mockery or a joke or riddle as part of the check.

- **Shapechanger**: The wicked skull can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny object or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isnâ€™t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

- **Petty Mockery**: The wicked skull unleashes a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature it can see within 60 feet.
