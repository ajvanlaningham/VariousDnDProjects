### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The death vulture makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.

- **Beak**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage.

- **Talons**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

- **Decaying Breath (Recharge 6)**: The vulture breathes necrotic energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail this saving throw by 5 or more also age a number of years equal to half the damage taken.
