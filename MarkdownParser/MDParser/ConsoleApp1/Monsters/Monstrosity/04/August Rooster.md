### Abilities
 --- 
- **Aura of Subservience**: A beast or humanoid that ends its turn within 30 feet of the august rooster and can see or hear it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 day. A charmed creature that moves more than 100 feet away from the august rooster ceases to be charmed. If the august rooster requests that a charmed creature do more than tend to the creature’s own needs, pay devotion to the august rooster, or bring the rooster food and gifts, the charmed creature can make a new saving throw with advantage. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the august rooster’s Aura of Subservience for 24 hours.

- **Dive Bomb**: If the august rooster is flying and moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a talon attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage.

- **Jumper**: The august rooster can fly up to 40 feet on its turn, but it must start and end its movement on a solid surface such as a roof or the ground. If it is flying at the end of its turn, it falls to the ground and takes falling damage.

- **Innate Spellcasting**: The august rooster’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The august rooster can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.
At will: dancing lights, mage hand, message, vicious mockery
3/day each: bane, charm person, hideous laughter
1/day each: healing word, hold person
