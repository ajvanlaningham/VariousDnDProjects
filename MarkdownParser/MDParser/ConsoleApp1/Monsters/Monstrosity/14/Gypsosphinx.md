 ---

- **Magic Weapons**: The sphinx's weapon attacks are magical.

- **Mystic Sight**: A gypsosphinx sees death coming and can foretell the manner of a person's death. This ability does not come with any urge to share that information. Gypsosphinxes are notorious for hinting, teasing, and even lying about a creature's death ("If we fight, I will kill you and eat your heart. I have seen it,"is a favorite bluff).
