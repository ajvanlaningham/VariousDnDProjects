### Abilities
 --- 
- **Corrupting Touch**: When a corrupting ooze scores a critical hit or starts its turn with a foe grappled, it can dissolve one leather, metal, or wood item of its choosing in the possession of the target creature. A mundane item is destroyed automatically; a magical item is destroyed if its owner fails to make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw.

- **Strong Swimmer**: A corrupting ooze naturally floats on the surface of water. It swims with a pulsating motion that propels it faster than walking speed.
