- **Sheath of Chaos**: Wraps its cloudy form tighter around those within it. Each creature in the wandering haze’s space: 27 (6d8) psychic and is disoriented until end of its next turn as its mind fills with gibbering terrors of chaos that created haze’s form (DC 17 Wis half damage and not disoriented). When a disoriented creature moves it moves in a random direction.

- **Acidic Cloudburst (Recharge 5–6)**: Releases a deluge of acid. Each creature within 10 ft. of it: 35 (10d6) acid and speed halved 1 min (DC 17 Dex half damage and speed not reduced). A creature with halved speed can make a DC 17 Con save at the end of each of its turns success ends effect on itself.
