- **Pseudopod**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 7 (1d6+4) bludgeoning damage + 9 (2d8) poison.

- **Poisonous Snap (Stretched Body Only Recharge 5–6)**: While it is covering an object or structure it can rapidly collapse back to its normal form ending the stretch and spraying all nearby creatures with poisonous slime. Each creature within 10 ft. of any space the stretched slime occupied before collapsing: 27 (6d8) poison and coated in poisonous slime (DC 15 Dex half not coated). A creature coated takes 9 (2d8) poison at start of each of its turns. A creature including slime-coated creature can take an action to clean it off.
