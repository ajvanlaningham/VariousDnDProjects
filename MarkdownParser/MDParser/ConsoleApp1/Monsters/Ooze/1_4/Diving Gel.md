- **Attach**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 5 ft., one creature,. The gel attaches itself to the head face or gills of a creature. If the creature is Large or smaller and can breathe air it continues to breathe normally as the air-filled gel provides breathable air for the creature. If the creature can’t breathe air it must hold its breath or begin to suffocate. If the gel is attached to a creature it has advantage on attack rolls vs. that creature. A creature including the target can take its action to detach the diving gel by succeeding on a DC 12 Str check.
