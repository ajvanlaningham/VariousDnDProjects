### Actions
 --- 
- **Pseudopod**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12).

- **Hurl Mote**: Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 10/30 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) fire damage.

- **Life Drain**: One creature grappled by the ooze must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken, and the ooze regains hp equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
