### Abilities
 --- 
- **False Appearance (Tree Form Only)**: While the skinner remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.

- **Inhabit Tree**: As a bonus action, the skinner touches a Medium or larger tree that is not a creature and disappears inside it. While inside the tree, the skinner has tremorsense with a radius of 30 feet, has an AC of 15, has a speed of 0, and has vulnerability to fire damage. When the skinner is reduced to 15 hp, the tree dies and the skinner appears within 5 feet of the dead tree or in the nearest unoccupied space. The skinner can exit the tree as a bonus action, appearing within 5 feet of the tree in the nearest unoccupied space, and the tree reverts to being an object. The skinner can inhabit a tree for only 3 days at most before the tree dies, requiring the skinner to seek another vessel.

- **Magic Resistance**: The skinner has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
