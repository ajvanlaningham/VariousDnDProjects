### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The devil attacks once with its beard and once with its glaive.

- **Beard**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage  and the target is poisoned until the end of the devils next turn. While poisoned in this way  the target can't regain hit points.

- **Glaive**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit  reach 10 ft.  one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or construct  it makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure  it receives an infernal wound and takes 5 (1d10) ongoing slashing damage. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack  the ongoing damage increases by 5 (1d10). A creature can spend an action to make a DC 12 Medicine check  ending the ongoing damage on a success. At least 1 hit point of magical healing also ends the ongoing damage.
