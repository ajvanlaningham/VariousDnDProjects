### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The scribe devil makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its tail.

- **Claws**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

- **Tail**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become blinded as its eyes turn black and fill with infernal ink. The condition can be removed with a greater restoration spell or similar magic. Alternatively, a creature with a healer’s kit can drain the ink from a blinded creature’s eyes with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check. If this check fails by 5 or more, the attempt to drain the ink instead removes the blinded creature’s eyes and the creature takes 21 (6d6) piercing damage.
