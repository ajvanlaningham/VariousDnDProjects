### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The arachnocrat makes two claw attacks. If both claws hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is restrained in gilded webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 13 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 12; hp 8; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The skin of a creature that dies while poisoned takes on a golden hue.
