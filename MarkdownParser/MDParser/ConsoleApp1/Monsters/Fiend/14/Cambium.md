### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The cambium makes four needle fingers attacks.

- **Needle Fingers**: Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage. In addition, the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw; if it fails, the cambium can either inflict Ability Damage or Imbalance Humors. A target makes this saving throw just once per turn, even if struck by more than one needle fingers attack.

- **Ability Damage (3/Day)**: When the target of the cambium's needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, one of its ability scores (cambium's choice) is reduced by 1d4 until it finishes a long rest. If this reduces a score to 0, the creature is unconscious until it regains at least one point.

- **Imbalance Humors (3/Day)**: When the target of the cambium's needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, apply one of the following effects:

- **Sanguine Flux: The target cannot be healed**: The target cannot be healed-naturally or magically-until after their next long rest.

- **Choleric Flux: The target becomes confused (as the spell) for 3d6 rounds**: The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shrug off the flux before the duration ends.

- **Melancholic Flux: The target is incapacitated for 1d4 rounds and slowed (as the spell) for 3d6 rounds**: The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shrug off the flux before the duration ends.

- **Phlegmatic Flux: A successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw negates this effect**: A failed saving throw means the target gains one level of exhaustion which lasts for 3d6 rounds.
