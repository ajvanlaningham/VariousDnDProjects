### Abilities
 --- 
- **Blood Armor**: The herald of blood takes no damage from the first attack against it each round and ignores any nondamaging effects of the attack.

- **Gift of Blood**: As an action, the herald of blood can transform any fey, human, or goblin into a red hag, if the target willingly accepts this transformation.

- **Grant Blood Rage**: As a bonus action, the herald of blood can grant a single living creature blood rage, giving it advantage on attacks for 3 rounds. At the end of this time, the target gains 1 level of exhaustion and suffers 13 (2d12) necrotic damage from blood loss.

- **Humanoid Form**: A herald of blood can assume a humanoid form at will as a bonus action, and dismiss this form at will.

- **Melting Touch**: When a herald of blood scores a critical hit or starts its turn with a foe grappled, it can dissolve one metal or wood item of its choosing in that foe's possession. A mundane item is destroyed automatically; a magical item survives if its owner makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.
