It has AC 20 and 20 hit points, a Speed of 0, and immunity to psychic, piercing, poison, and thunder damage. When the devil uses Multiattack, the devil may command the chain to make one Chain attack against a target within 15 feet of it. If the chain is reduced to 0 hit points, it can't be reanimated.

### Reactions

- **Unnerving Mask**: When damaged by a creature within 30 feet that can see the devil, the devil momentarily assumes the magical illusory form of one of the attackers enemies or loved ones, alive or dead. The illusory figure may speak words that only the attacker can hear. The attacker makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it takes 9 (2d8) psychic damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn.The attacker is then immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
