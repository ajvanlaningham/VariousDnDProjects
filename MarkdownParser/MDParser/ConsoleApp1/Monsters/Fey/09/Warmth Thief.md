### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The warmth thief makes two freezing claw attacks.

- **Freezing Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) cold damage. The warmth thief regains hp equal to half the cold damage dealt. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be chilled for 1 minute. A chilled creature takes 7 (2d6) cold damage at the start of each of its turns. A chilled creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A humanoid slain while chilled rises 24 hours later as a chill haunt, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.
