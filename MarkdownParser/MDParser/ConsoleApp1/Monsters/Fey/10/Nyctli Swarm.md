The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 42 (12d6) necrotic damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
