### Abilities
 --- 
- **Expert Wrestler**: The scrofin can grapple creatures that are two sizes larger than itself and can move at its full speed when dragging a creature it has grappled. If the scrofin grapples a Medium or smaller creature, the target has disadvantage on its escape attempts. In addition, the scrofin has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple or end the restrained condition.

- **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**: If the scrofin takes 10 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hp, it is reduced to 1 hp instead.

### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The scrofin makes two attacks: one with its fist and one with its gore or two with its fists.

- **Fist**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). The scrofin can grapple only one target at a time. If the scrofin scores a critical hit, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of its next turn.

- **Gore**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Quick to Anger (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**: If the scrofin is wrestling a foe as part of a challenge and takes damage, or when it is reduced to half its hp maximum, it becomes angry. While angry, the scrofin has advantage on melee attack rolls and on saving throws against spells or effects that would charm or frighten it or make it unconscious, and it has resistance to bludgeoning damage. It remains angry for 1 minute, or until it is knocked unconscious. Alternatively, it can end its anger as a bonus action.
