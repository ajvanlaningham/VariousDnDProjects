- **Hex (Gaze)**: A creature within 60 feet that is not already under a hags hex makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. A creature under an obligation to the hag automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed saving throw  the target is cursed with a magical hex that lasts 30 days. The curse ends early if the target suffers harm from the hag or if the hag ends it as an action. Roll 1d4:

- **3**: Ill Fortune Hex. The hag magically divines the targets activities. Whenever the target attempts a long-duration task such as a craft or downtime activity  the hag can cause the activity to fail.

- **4**: Sleep Hex. The target falls unconscious. The curse ends early if the target takes damage or if a creature uses an action to shake it awake.

- **Invisibility (2nd-Level; V, S, Concentration)**: The hag is invisible for 1 hour. The spell ends if the hag attacks  uses Hex  or casts a spell.
