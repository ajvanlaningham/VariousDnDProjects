### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The selang makes two dagger attacks or two shortbow attacks.

- **Dagger**: Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage, plus sleep poison.

- **Shortbow**: Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80/320, one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus sleep poison.

- **Sleep Poison**: An injured creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 2d6 rounds. A creature poisoned in this way is unconscious. An unconscious creature wakes if it takes damage, or if a creature uses its action to shake it awake.

- **Alien Piping**: A selang can confuse and injure its enemies by playing weird, ear-bending harmonies on alien pipes, made from the beaks, cartilage, and throat sacs of a dorreq. When the selang plays a tune on these pipes, all creatures within 60 feet must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by contagion, confusion, irresistible dance, or hideous laughter, depending on what alien and otherworldly music the dark satyr chooses to play. A creature that saves successfully against this psychic effect is immune to the piping for 24 hours. The selang can use each of these spell-like effects once per day.
