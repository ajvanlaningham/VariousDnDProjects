### Abilities
 --- 
- **Aura of Drunkenness**: The rum lord radiates an aura of drunkenness to a radius of 20 feet. Each creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A creature that has consumed alcohol within the past hour has disadvantage on the saving throw. While poisoned, a creature falls prone if it tries to move more than half its speed during a turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the rum gremlin lord’s Aura of Drunkenness for 24 hours.

- **Hearty**: The rum lord adds its Constitution modifier to its AC (included in the Armor Class).

- **Magic Resistance**: The rum lord has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

- **One for the Road**: When the rum lord hits a poisoned enemy with any weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage.

### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The rum lord makes two attacks: one with its ale tap scepter and one with its broken bottle shiv.

- **Ale Tap Scepter**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

- **Broken Bottle Shiv**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

- **Rotgut Belch (Recharge 6)**: The rum lord vomits green bile in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 18 (4d8) poison damage and is covered in green bile for 1 minute. On a success, a target takes half the damage and isn’t covered in bile. A creature, including the target, can take an action to wipe off the bile. Rum gremlins have advantage on attack rolls against creatures covered in a rum lord’s green bile.

- **Bring Me Another Round! (1/Day)**: The rum lord lets out a thunderous belch, calling 1d4 rum gremlins. The called rum gremlins arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the lord and obeying its spoken commands. The rum gremlins remain for 1 hour, until the lord dies, or until the lord dismisses them as a bonus action.
