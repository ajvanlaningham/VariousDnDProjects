### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The knight makes two melee attacks.

- **Glittering Scimitar**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold  fire  or lightning damage (its choice).

- **Longbow**: Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit  range 150/600 ft.  one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points  the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour  even if it regains hit points  and it is asleep while poisoned in this way.

- **Fey Glamour**: The knight targets one humanoid within 30 feet. The target makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  it is magically charmed by the knight for 1 day. If the knight or one of the knights allies harms the target  the target repeats the saving throw  ending the effect on itself on a success. If a targets saving throw is successful  or if the effect ends for it  the creature is immune to this knights Fey Charm for a year and a day.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Natures Shield**: When the knight would be hit by an attack while the knight is within 5 feet of a tree or other large plant, the knights AC magically increases by 3 against that attack as the plant interposes branches or vines between the knight and the attacker.
