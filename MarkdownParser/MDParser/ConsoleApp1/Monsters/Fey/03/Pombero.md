- **Fist**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 13).

- **Charming Touch (recharge 5-6)**: The pombero chooses a creature it can see within 5 feet. The creature must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 10 minutes. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes damage. The pombero can have only one creature at a time charmed with this ability. If it charms a new creature, the previous charm effect ends immediately.

- **Invisibility**: The pombero becomes invisible until it chooses to end the effect as a bonus action, or when it attacks.
