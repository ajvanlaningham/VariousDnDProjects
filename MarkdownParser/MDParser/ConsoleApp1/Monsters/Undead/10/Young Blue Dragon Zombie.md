### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The dragon zombie makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) necrotic damage.

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

- **Rotting Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon zombie exhales rotting breath in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A humanoid reduced to 0 hp by this damage dies, and it rises as a zombie and acts immediately after the dragon zombie in the initiative count. The new zombie is under the control of the creature controlling the dragon zombie.
