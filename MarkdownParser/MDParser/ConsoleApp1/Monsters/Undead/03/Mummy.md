### Abilities
 --- 
- **Flammable**: After taking fire damage, the mummy catches fire and takes 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage if it isnt already suffering ongoing fire damage. A creature can use an action to extinguish this fire.

- **Curse: Mummy Rot**: A mummys touch inflicts a dreadful curse called mummy rot. A cursed creature can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the creatures total number of Hit Dice for every 24 hours that elapse. If this curse reduces the targets hit point maximum to 0, the target dies and crumbles to dust. Remove curse and similar magic ends the curse.
