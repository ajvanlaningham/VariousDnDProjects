### Actions
 --- 
- **Disheartening Touch**: Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) psychic damage.

- **Steal Joy (Recharge 5-6)**: Each creature of the bleakheart’s choice that is within 20 feet of the bleakheart and aware of it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or its Charisma score is reduced by 1d4. A creature that has taken psychic damage from the bleakheart’s Disheartening Touch within the last minute has disadvantage on this saving throw. A creature that has its Charisma reduced to 0 ends its life at the earliest opportunity, and a new bleakheart rises from its corpse 1d4 hours later. Otherwise, the Charisma reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
