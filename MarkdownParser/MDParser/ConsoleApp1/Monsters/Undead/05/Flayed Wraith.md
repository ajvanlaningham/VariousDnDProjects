- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage plus 5 (2d4) necrotic damage.

- **Howl of Agony**: The wraith screams its pain into the mind of one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and is incapacitated as it doubles over in pain. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isnâ€™t incapacitated.
