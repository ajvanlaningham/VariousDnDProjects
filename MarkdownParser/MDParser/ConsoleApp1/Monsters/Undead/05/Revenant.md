### Abilities
 --- 
- **Fearsome Pursuit**: The revenant can spend 1 minute focusing on a creature against which it has sworn vengeance. If the creature is dead or on another plane of existence, it learns that. Otherwise, after focusing, it knows the distance and direction to that creature, and so long as its moving in pursuit of that creature, it ignores difficult terrain. This effect ends if the revenant takes damage or ends its turn without moving for any reason.

- **Magic Resistance**: The revenant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

- **Rapid Recovery**: If the revenant goes 1 minute without taking damage, it regains all its missing hit points.

- **Relentless**: When the revenant is reduced to 0 hit points, its body turns to dust. One minute later, its spirit inhabits a recently-dead humanoid corpse of its choice on the same plane of existence, awakening with 1 hit point.
