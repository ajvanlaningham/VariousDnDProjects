 --- 
- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage.

- **Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons: 
* Shard Breath. The skeleton exhales a 15-foot cone of bone shards. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
* Noxious Breath. The skeleton exhales a 15-foot cone of gas. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on itself on a success.
