### Actions
 --- 
- **Shortbow**: Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

- **Corrupting Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) necrotic damage at the start of its next turn.

- **Invisibility**: The cadaver sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.
