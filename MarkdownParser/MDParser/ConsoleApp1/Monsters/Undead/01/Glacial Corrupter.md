### Actions
 --- 
- **Longsword**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage, or 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage if used with two hands.

- **Longbow**: Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

- **Glacial Touch (Recharge 5-6)**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) cold damage at the start of each of its turns, as a frozen shard lodges itself in the wound. Any creature can take an action to remove the shard with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The shard crumbles to snow if the target receives magical healing.

A humanoid slain by this attack rises in 1 week as a glacial corrupter, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.
