### Abilities
 --- 
- **Charge**: If the ghost knight is mounted and moves at least 30 feet in a straight line toward a target and hits it with a melee attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage.

- **Mounted Warrior**: When mounted, the ghost knight has advantage on attacks against unmounted creatures smaller than its mount. If the ghost knight's mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to take half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw, the mount instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and half damage if it fails.

- **Turning Defiance**: The ghost knight and all darakhul or ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

- **Undead Nature**: A ghost knight doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep
