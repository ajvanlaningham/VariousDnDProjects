### Actions
 --- 
- **Wind of Decay**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with tomb rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or comparable magic.
