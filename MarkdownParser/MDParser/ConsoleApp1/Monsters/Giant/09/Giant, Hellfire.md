### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: Two Greatclub or Runic Blast attacks.

- **Greatclub**: Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, 15 ft., one target, 19 (3d8+6) bludgeoning damage + 9 (2d8) fire.

- **Runic Blast**: Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, 60 ft., one target, 25 (4d10+3) force and target's speed halved until end of its next turn (DC 16 Con not half speed). Fiends have disadvantage on the save.

- **Invisibility Rune**: Magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the giant wears or carries is invisible with it.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Runic Shield**: Adds 4 to its AC vs. one attack that would hit it as green runes encircle the giant. To do so giant must see the attacker and canâ€™t be invisible
