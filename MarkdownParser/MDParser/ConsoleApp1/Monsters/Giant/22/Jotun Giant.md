### Actions

- **Multiattack**: The giant makes two greatclub attacks and a frightful presence attack, or one rock throwing attack.

- **Greatclub**: Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 55 (10d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

- **Rock**: Ranged Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, range 90/240 ft., one target. Hit: 49 (6d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

- **Frightful Presence**: Each creature of the giant's choice that is within 120 feet of the giant and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature's saving throw is successful, it is immune to the giant's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

### Reactions

- **Rock Catching**: If a rock or similar object is hurled at the giant, the giant can, with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, catch the missile and take no bludgeoning damage from it.

### Legendary Actions
 --- 
- **Detect**: The Jotun giant makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

- **Planar Return**: If banished, a Jotun giant can return to the plane it departed 2/day. If banished a third time, it cannot return.

- **Sweeping Blow**: The Jotun giant can sweep its greatclub in an arc around itself. The sweep affects a semicircular path 30 feet wide around the giant. All targets in that area take 46 (8d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage, or no damage with a successful DC 19 Dexterity saving throw.
