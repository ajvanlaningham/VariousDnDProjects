### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: Two Obsidian Axe or Firestorm Bolt attacks.

- **Obsidian Axe**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, 10 ft., one target, 19 (3d8+6) slashing damage + 3 (1d6) cold and 3 (1d6) fire.

- **Firestorm Bolt**: Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, 120 ft., one target, 13 (3d6+3) fire + 10 (3d6) cold.

- **Lava Geyser (Recharge 5–6)**: Gestures at a point on the ground it can see within 60' of it. A fountain of molten rock erupts from that point in a 10 ft. radius 40' high cylinder. The area is difficult terrain for 1 min. Each creature in the cylinder must make a DC 16 Dex save. On a failure a creature takes 24 (7d6) fire and is coated in hardened lava. On a success a creature takes half the damage and isn’t coated in hardened lava. A creature coated in hardened lava has its speed halved while it remains coated. A creature including the coated creature can take its action to break and remove the hardened lava ending the effect.
