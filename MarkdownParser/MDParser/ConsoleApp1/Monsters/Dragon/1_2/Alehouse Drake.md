*(Tiny) (Dragon) *

**Initiative:** 16
**Proficiency Bonus:**

### Abilities
 --- 
- **Innate Spellcasting**: the drake's innate casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: friends, vicious mockery

5/day each: calm emotions, dissonant whispers, ray of sickness, hideous laughter

3/day each: confusion, invisibility

- **Forgetful Spellcasting**: When a creature fails an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw against a spell cast by an alehouse drake, the creature immediately forgets the source of the spellcasting.

### Actions
 --- 
- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.

- **Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6)**: An alehouse drake can burp a cloud of intoxicating gas in a 15-foot cone. A creature caught in the cloud becomes poisoned for 1 minute and must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1d6 rounds.

- **Discombobulating Touch**: An alehouse drake can make a touch attack that grants its target +3 to Dexterity-based skill checks and melee attacks but also induces confusion as per the spell. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw negates this effect.
