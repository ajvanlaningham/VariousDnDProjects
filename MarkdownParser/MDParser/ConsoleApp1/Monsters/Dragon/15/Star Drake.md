### Abilities
 --- 
- **Legendary Resistance (2/day)**: If the star drake fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

- **Magic Resistance**: The drake has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

- **Magic Weapons**: The drake's weapon attacks are magical.

- **Nimbus of Stars**: The drake is surrounded by a whirling nimbus of tiny motes of starlight. A sighted creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the drake must make a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated. At the start of a character's turn, a character can choose to avert its eyes and gain immunity against this effect until the start of its next turn, but it must treat the drake as invisible while the character's eyes are averted.

- **Innate Spellcasting**: the drake's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 20). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: faerie fire, moonbeam

3/day: plane shift

1/day each: gate, planar binding
