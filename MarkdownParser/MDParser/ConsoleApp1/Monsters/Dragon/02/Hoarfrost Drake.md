### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The hoarfrost drake makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) cold damage.

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.

- **Cloud of Riming Ice (Recharge 5-6)**: The hoarfrost drake creates a cloud of freezing fog that rimes everything in frost. Each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 14 (4d6) cold damage and must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or drop whatever it’s holding. On a success, the target takes half the damage and doesn’t drop what it’s holding.

The area becomes difficult terrain until the end of the hoarfrost drake’s next turn. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Retaliatory Slip**: When a creature grapples the drake, the drake can immediately attempt to escape. If it succeeds, it can make a bite attack against the creature that grappled it.
