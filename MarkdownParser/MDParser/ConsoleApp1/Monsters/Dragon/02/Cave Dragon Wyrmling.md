- **Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon exhales a cone of black poison gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save and the target is poisoned if it is a creature. The poisoned condition lasts until the target takes a long or short rest or removes the condition with lesser restoration. If the save is successful, the target takes half the damage and does not become poisoned.
