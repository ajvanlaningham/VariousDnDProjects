### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The linnorm can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tail.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage.

- **Tail**: Melee Weapon Attack. +12 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 18) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the linnorm doesn’t have two other creatures grappled. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.

- **Frightful Presence**: Each creature of the linnorm’s choice that is within 120 feet of the linnorm and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the linnorm’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

- **Inky Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The linnorm exhales a cloud of briny ink in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 52 (15d6) necrotic damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
