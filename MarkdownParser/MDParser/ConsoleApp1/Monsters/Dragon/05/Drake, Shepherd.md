Each friendly Beast in area gains 5 (1d10) temp hp or 11 (2d10) temp hp if it is charmed by the drake.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Shepherd’s Safeguard**: When a Beast within 30' of the drake would be hit by an attack drake can chirp and beast adds 3 to its AC vs. the attack. To do so drake must see attacker and Beast.
