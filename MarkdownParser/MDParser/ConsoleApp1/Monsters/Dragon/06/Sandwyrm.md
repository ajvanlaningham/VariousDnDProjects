### Abilities
 --- 
- **Spine Trap**: When underground with its spines exposed, the sandwyrm can snap its spines closed on one Large, two Medium, or four Small or Tiny creatures above it. Each creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check to free itself or another restrained creature, ending the effect on a success. Creatures restrained by this trait move with the sandwyrm. The sandwyrm's stinger attack has advantage against creatures restrained by this trait.

### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The sandwyrm makes one bite attack and one stinger attack. It can gore in place of the bite attack.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.

- **Gore**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage.

- **Stinger**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 24 (7d6) poison damage, or half as much poison damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned and paralyzed for 1 hour. Regaining hit points doesn't end the poisoning or paralysis.
