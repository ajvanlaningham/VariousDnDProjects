 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The wyvern attacks once with its bite and once with its stinger. While flying  it can use its claws in place of one other attack.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit  reach 10 ft.  one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

- **Claws**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage. If the wyvern is attacking from above  the target is grappled by the wyvern (escape DC 15). While grappling a target in this way  the wyverns Speed is reduced to 0  it can't use its claws to attack any other creature  and it has advantage on attacks against the target.

- **Stinger**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit  reach 10 ft.  one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. The target makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw  taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failure or half damage on a success.
