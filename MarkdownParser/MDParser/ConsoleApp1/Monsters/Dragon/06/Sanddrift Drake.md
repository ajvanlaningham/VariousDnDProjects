### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The drake makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its speed is halved for 1 minute. If the target’s speed is already halved and it fails the saving throw, it is paralyzed for 1 minute instead. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

- **Heatwave Breath (Recharge 6)**: The drake exhales superheated air in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it suffers one level of exhaustion.
