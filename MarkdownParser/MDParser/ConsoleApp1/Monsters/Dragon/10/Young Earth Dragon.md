### Abilities
 --- 
- **Earth Glide**: The dragon can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing it.

- **False Appearance**: While the dragon remains motionless within its linked area, it is indistinguishable from a natural rocky outcropping.

- **Essence Link**: The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.

- **Innate Spellcasting**: The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:locate animals or plants, spike growth
