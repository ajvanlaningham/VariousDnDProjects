### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The coral drake makes one bite attack, one claw attack, and one stinger attack.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) slashing damage.

- **Stinger**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns for 4 rounds. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

- **Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6)**: Coral drakes nurture their offspring in specialized throat sacs. They can pressurize these sacs to spew forth a 15-foot cone of spawn. Each target in this area takes 21 (6d6) piercing damage from thousands of tiny bites and is blinded for 1d4 rounds; a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blindness.
