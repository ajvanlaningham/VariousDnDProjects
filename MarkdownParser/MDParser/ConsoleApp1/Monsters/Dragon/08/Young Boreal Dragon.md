### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage.

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

- **Cinder Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon exhales a 30-foot cone of superheated air filled with white-hot embers. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
