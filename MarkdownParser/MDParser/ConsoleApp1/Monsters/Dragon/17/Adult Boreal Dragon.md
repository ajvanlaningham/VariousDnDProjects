### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.

- **Tail**: Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

- **Frightful Presence**: Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

- **Cinder Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon exhales a 60-foot cone of superheated air filled with white-hot embers. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Legendary Actions
 --- 
- **Detect**: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

- **Tail Attack**: The dragon makes a tail attack.

- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
