### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The drake makes one bite attack, two claw attacks, and one stinger attack.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage.

- **Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

- **Stinger**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4 rounds. While poisoned this way, the target must repeat the save at the start of its turn, ending the condition on a success. On a failure, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage. When animate dead is cast on creatures killed by this poison, the caster requires no material components.

- **Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6)**: A deep drake blasts forth a crackling 80-foot line of purple-black energy that wracks its victims with pain. This attack deals 35 (10d6) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Targets that fail this saving throw must also succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1d4 rounds.
