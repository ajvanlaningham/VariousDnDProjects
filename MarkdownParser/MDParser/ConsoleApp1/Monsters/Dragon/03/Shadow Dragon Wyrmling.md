### Abilities
 --- 
- **Evil**: The dragon radiates an Evil aura.

- **Incorporeal Movement**: The dragon can move through other creatures and objects. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

- **Essence Link**: The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.
