### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

- **Scimitar**: Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.

- **Lightning Blast**: Ranged Spell Attack: +9 to hit  range 90 ft.  one target. Hit: 35 (10d6) lightning damage.

- **Scimitar Sweep (1/Day, Giant Form Only)**: The djinn makes a scimitar attack against each creature of its choice within its reach.

### Bonus Actions
 --- 
- **Giant Form (1/Day**: The djinni magically becomes a Huge, semi-substantial creature of billowing cloud. In this form, it gains resistance to nonmagical damage, and its scimitar attacks gain a reach of 10 feet. The effect ends after 1 minute, when the djinni is incapacitated, or if the djinn becomes bloodied.

- **Whirlwind (1/Day)**: A magical, 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-tall whirlwind appears in a space the djinni can see within 60 feet. The whirlwind may appear in another creatures space. If the whirlwind appears in another creatures space, or when it enters a creatures space for the first time on a turn, the creature makes a DC 18 Strength check, becoming restrained by the whirlwind on a failure. The whirlwind may restrain one creature at a time. A creature within 5 feet of the whirlwind (including the restrained creature) can use an action to make a DC 18 Strength check, freeing the restrained creature on a success. A freed creature can move to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the whirlwind.

- **As a bonus action**: The whirlwind disappears if the djinni loses sight of it, if the djinni dies or is incapacitated, or if the djinni dismisses it as an action.
