### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The marid makes two trident attacks. One of these can be replaced with a net attack.

- **Trident**: Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit  reach 10 ft. or range 20/60 ft.  one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage. If thrown  the trident returns to the marids hand.

- **Net**: Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit  range 5/15 ft.  one target. Hit: A Large  Medium  or Small target is restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 18 Strength check  freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net is an object with AC 10  20 hit points  vulnerability to slashing damage  and immunity to bludgeoning  poison  and psychic damage.

### Bonus Actions
 --- 
- **Fog Cloud (1/Day)**: The marid magically creates a heavily obscured area of fog (or, if underwater, inky water) in a 30-foot radius around a point it can see within 60 feet. The fog spreads around corners and can be dispersed by a moderate wind or current (at least 10 miles per hour). Otherwise, it disperses after 10 minutes. The marid can see through this fog.

- **Water Jet (While Bloodied)**: The marid shoots water in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long jet. Each creature in the area makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 20 feet away from the marid, to a maximum of 60 feet away, and knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half damage.
