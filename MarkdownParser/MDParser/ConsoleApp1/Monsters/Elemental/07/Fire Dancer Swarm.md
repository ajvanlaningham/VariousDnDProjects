### Abilities
 --- 
- **Fire Form**: A creature that touches the swarm or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the first time the swarm enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire; until someone uses an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

- **Illumination**: The swarm sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light to an additional 30 feet.

- **Swarm**: The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

- **Water Susceptibility**: For every 5 feet the swarm moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.
