- **Acidic Tears**: Thick tears of dark sap stream continuously down the treant's face and trunk. These tears are highly acidic - anyone who attacks the treant from a range of 5 feet or less must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 6 (1d12) acid damage from splashed tears. This acidic matter continues doing 6 (1d12) acid damage at the start of each of the creature's turns until it or an adjacent ally uses an action to wipe off the tears or three rounds elapse.
