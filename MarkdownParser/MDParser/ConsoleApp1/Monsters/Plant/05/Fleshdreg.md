- **Disgorge Innards (Recharge 6)**: The fleshdreg expels acidic sludge in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 9 (2d8) acid damage the end of its next turn, unless it or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to remove the sludge.
