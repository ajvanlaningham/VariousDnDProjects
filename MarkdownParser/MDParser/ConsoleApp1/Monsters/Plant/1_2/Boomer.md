### Abilities
 --- 
- **Deafening Boom**: When a creature hits the boomer with a melee attack, the boomer releases a blast of sound. Each creature within 10 feet of the boomer that can hear it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 5 (2d4) thunder damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t incapacitated.

- **Death Burst**: When it dies, the boomer explodes in a cacophonous burst. Each creature within 30 feet of the boomer that can hear it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t deafened.

- **False Appearance**: While the boomer remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary fungus.
