### Abilities

- **Luring Scent**: When a beast, humanoid or fey creature begins its turn within 30 feet, the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it moves as close as it can to the wallflower and ends its turn. Creatures immune to being charmed are immune to this effect. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Luring Scent of all wallflowers for 24 hours.
