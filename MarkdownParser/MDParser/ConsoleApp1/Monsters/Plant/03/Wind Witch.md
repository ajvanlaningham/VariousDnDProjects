- **Flammable**: When it takes fire damage catches fire taking 3 (1d6) fire at start of each of its turns. Burns until it takes cold or is immersed in water. Creature that touches wind witch or hits it with melee attack while within 5 ft. of it while it is burning takes 3 (1d6) fire. While burning deals extra 3 (1d6) fire on each melee attack and deals 7 (2d6) fire to a captured creature at start of its turn.

Restrained target can’t be hit by wind witch’s Slam but takes 5 (2d4) piercing damage if it takes action that requires movement (ex: attack or cast somatic spell). When it moves captured creature moves with it. Can have only one creature captured at a time.
