 --- 
- **Ethereal and Material**: The dead mans fingers lives simultaneously on the Ethereal and Material Planes. Its senses extend into both planes, and it can touch and be touched by creatures on both planes.

- **Ethereal Shift**: When a creature on the Material Plane touches the dead mans fingers or hits it with a melee attack, the creature is magically transported to the Ethereal Plane. The creature can see and hear into both the Ethereal and Material Plane but is unaffected by creatures and objects on the Material Plane. It can be seen as a ghostly form by creatures on the Material Plane. It can move in any direction, with each foot of movement up or down costing 2 feet of movement.

- **If the creature is still on the Ethereal Plane when the dead mans fingers dies, the creature returns to the Material Plane**: If this would cause a creature to appear in a space occupied by a solid object or creature, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes 10 (3d6) force damage.

- **Flammable**: After taking fire damage, the dead mans fingers catches fire and takes ongoing 11 (2d10) fire damage if it isnt already suffering ongoing fire damage. It can spend an action or bonus action to extinguish this fire.
