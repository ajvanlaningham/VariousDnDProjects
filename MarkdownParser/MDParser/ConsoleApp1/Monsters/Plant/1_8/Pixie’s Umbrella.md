### Actions
 --- 
- **Twirl**: The pixie’s umbrella twirls, spinning its spores at nearby creatures. Each creature within 5 feet of the pixie’s umbrella must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also poisoned until the end of its next turn.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Float**: When a pixie’s umbrella senses motion within 30 feet of it, it fills its cap with air and flies 20 feet away from the motion without provoking opportunity attacks.
