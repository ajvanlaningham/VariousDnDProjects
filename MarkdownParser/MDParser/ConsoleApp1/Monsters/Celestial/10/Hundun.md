### Abilities
 --- 
- **Brainless**: Hunduns are immune to any spell or effect that allows an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw. Trying to contact or read a Hundun's mind confuses the caster as the spell for 1 round.

- **Dance of Creation**: Hunduns can perform an act of magical creation almost unlimited in scope every 1d8 days. The effect is equivalent to a wish spell, but it must create something.

- **Enlightening Befuddlement**: when a hundun's confusion spell affects a target, it can elect to use the following table rather than the standard one:

1d100 Result

- **01-10 Inspired:**: Advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws

- **11-20 Distracted:**: Disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws

- **21-50 Incoherent:**: The target does nothing but babble or scribble incoherent notes on a new idea

- **51-75 Obsessed:**: Target is recipient of geas to create a quality magical object

- **76-100 Suggestible:**: Target receives a suggestion from the hundun

- **Innate Spellcasting**: the hundun's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17). It can cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

constant: confusion (always centered on the hundun), detect thoughts

at will: create or destroy water, dancing lights, mending, prestidigitation

3/day each: compulsion, dimension door, black tentacles, irresistible dance

1/day each: awaken, creation, heroes' feast, magnificent mansion, plant growth, reincarnate, stone shape

- **Magic Weapons**: The hundun's weapon attacks are magical.
