### Abilities
 --- 
- **Redemption**: Any caster brave enough to cast a knock spell on a chained angel can remove the creature's shackles, but this always exposes the caster to a blast of unholy flame as a reaction. The caster takes 16 (3d10) fire damage and 16 (3d10) radiant damage, or half as much with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. If the caster survives, the angel makes an immediate DC 20 Wisdom saving throw; if it succeeds, the angel's chains fall away and it is restored to its senses and to a Good alignment. If the saving throw fails, any further attempts to cast knock on the angel's chains fail automatically for one week.

### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The chained angel makes two fiery greatsword attacks.

- **Fiery Greatsword**: Melee Weapon Attack. +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 16 (3d10) fire damage.

- **Fallen Glory (Recharge 5-6)**: All creatures within 50 feet of the chained angel and in its line of sight take 19 (3d12) radiant damage and are knocked prone, or take half damage and aren't knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Fiendish Cunning**: When a creature within 60 feet casts a divine spell, the chained angel can counter the spell if it succeeds on a Charisma check against a DC of 10 + the spell's level.
