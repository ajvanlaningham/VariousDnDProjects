- **Fearsome Bark (Recharge 5-6)**: The chamrosh lets out a highpitched bark at a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target is of evil alignment, it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. The bark has no effect on neutral or good-aligned creatures.
