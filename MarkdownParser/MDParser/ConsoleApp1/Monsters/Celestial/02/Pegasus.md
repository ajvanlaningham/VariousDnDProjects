 --- 
- **Good**: The pegasus radiates a Good aura.

- **Divine Mount**: Over the course of a short rest, a willing pegasus can form a bond with a rider. Once this bond is formed, the rider suffers no penalties for riding the pegasus without a saddle. Additionally, if an effect forces both the pegasus and its rider to roll a saving throw, the pegasus automatically succeeds if the rider succeeds. If the pegasus bonds with a new rider, the previous bond ends.
