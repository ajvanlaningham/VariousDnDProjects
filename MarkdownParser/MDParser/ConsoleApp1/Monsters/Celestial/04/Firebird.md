### Abilities
 --- 
- **Innate Spellcasting**: the firebird's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: guidance, purify food and drink, speak with animals

3/day each: charm person, cure wounds (2d8 + 5), daylight, faerie fire, heat metal, hypnotic pattern, tongues

1/day each: geas, heal, reincarnate

- **Light of the World**: The firebird's feathers glow with a warm light. The creature sheds light as dim as a candle or as bright as a lantern. It always sheds light, and any feathers plucked from the creature continue to shed light as a torch.

- **Warming Presence**: The firebird and any creatures within a 5-foot radius are immune to the effects of natural, environmental cold. Invited into a home or building, a firebird can expand this warming presence to its inhabitants no matter how close they are to the creature.

- **Blinding Ray (Recharge 5-6)**: The firebird can fire a burning ray of light from its tail feathers in a line 5 feet wide and up to 50 feet long.
