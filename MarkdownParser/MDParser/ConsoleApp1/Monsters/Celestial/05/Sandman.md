### Abilities
 --- 
- **Eye-Closer's Curse**: If a sandman obtains a critical hit or successful surprise attack against an opponent, its talons scratch a rune onto the target's eyeballs that snaps their eyelids shut, leaving them blinded. This effect can be ended with greater restoration, remove curse, or comparable magic.

- **Innate Spellcasting**: the sandman's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: darkness, minor illusion, plane shift (at night only), phantom steed, prestidigitation, sleep (11d8)

3/day each: hypnotic pattern, major image

1/day each: dream, phantasmal killer (5d10)

- **Stuff of Dreams**: Made partially from dreams and imagination, a sandman takes only half damage from critical hits and from sneak attacks. All of the attack's damage is halved, not just bonus damage.

- **Surprise Attack**: If the sandman hits a surprised creature during the first round of combat, the target takes 14 (4d6) extra damage from the attack.
