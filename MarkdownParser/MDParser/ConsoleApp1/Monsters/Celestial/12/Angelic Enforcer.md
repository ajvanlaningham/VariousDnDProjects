### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The angelic enforcer makes two melee attacks, but can use its bite only once.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be cursed for 1 minute. While cursed, the target can’t regain hit points or benefit from an angel’s Healing Touch action. The curse can be lifted early by a remove curse spell or similar magic.

- **Greatsword**: Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (4d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 18 (4d8) fire damage.

- **Change Shape**: The angelic enforcer magically polymorphs into a humanoid or a lion that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the enforcer’s choice). In a new form, the enforcer retains its own game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has.
