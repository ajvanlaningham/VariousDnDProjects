### Abilities
 --- 
- **Asgardian Weapons**: The valkyrie's weapon attacks are magical. When she hits with any weapon, it does an extra 11 (2d10) radiant damage (included in attacks listed below).

- **Cloak of Doom**: Any living creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of a valkyrie senses her unsettling presence and must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be frightened for 1d4 rounds. Those who succeed are immune to the effect for 24 hours. The valkyrie can suppress this aura at will.

- **Gift of Tongues**: Valkyries become fluent in any language they hear spoken for at least 1 minute, and they retain this knowledge forever.

- **Innate Spellcasting**: the valkyrie's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: bane, bless, invisibility, sacred flame, spare the dying, speak with animals, thaumaturgy

5/day each: gentle repose, healing word, warding bond

3/day each: beacon of hope, mass healing word, revivify

1/day each: commune, death ward, freedom of movement, geas

- **Spear**: Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 11 (2d10) radiant damage.

### Legendary Actions
 --- 
- **Cast a Cantrip**: The valkyrie casts one spell from her at-will list.

- **Spear or Longsword Attack**: The valkyrie makes one longsword or spear attack.

- **Harvest the Fallen (Costs 2 Actions)**: A valkyrie can take the soul of a newly dead body and bind it into a weapon or shield. Only one soul can be bound to any object. Individuals whose souls are bound can't be raised by any means short of a wish or comparable magic. A valkyrie can likewise release any soul that has been bound by another valkyrie, or transfer a bound soul from one object to another. Once bound, the soul grants the item a +1 bonus for every 4 character levels of the soul (maximum of +3), and this replaces any other magic on the item. At the DM's discretion, part of this bonus can become an appropriate special quality (a fire giant's soul might create a flaming weapon, for example).
