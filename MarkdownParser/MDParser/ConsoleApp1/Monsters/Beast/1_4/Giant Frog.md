 --- 
- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 4 (1d6+1) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends  the frog can't bite another target.

- **Swallow**: The frog makes a bite attack against a Small or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits and the frog has not swallowed another creature  the target is swallowed and the grapple ends. A swallowed creature has total cover from attacks from outside the frog  it is blinded and restrained  and it takes 5 (2d4) acid damage at the beginning of each of the frogs turns. If the frog dies  the target is no longer swallowed.

- **Vaulting Leap**: The frog jumps up to 10 feet horizontally and 5 feet vertically. If its within 5 feet of a creature that it is not grappling at the end of this movement  it may make a bite attack against that creature with advantage.
