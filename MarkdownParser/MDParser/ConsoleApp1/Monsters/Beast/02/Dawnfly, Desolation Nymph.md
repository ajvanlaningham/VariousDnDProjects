If the target is a Med or smaller creature it is grappled (escape DC 13) and pulled to within 5 ft. of the nymph. Until this grapple ends the target is restrained and the desolation nymph can’t use its Hinged Maw on another target.

The nymph can have only 1 foe swallowed at a time. If the desolation nymph dies a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 ft. of movement exiting prone.
