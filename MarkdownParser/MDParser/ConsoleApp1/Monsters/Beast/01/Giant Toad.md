 --- 
- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) poison damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends  the toad can't bite another target.

- **Swallow**: The toad makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits and the toad has not swallowed another creature  the target is swallowed and the grapple ends. A swallowed creature has total cover from attacks from outside the toad  it is blinded and restrained  and it takes 7 (2d6) acid damage at the beginning of each of the toads turns. If the toad dies  the target is no longer swallowed.

- **Vaulting Leap**: The toad jumps up to 20 feet horizontally and 10 feet vertically. If its within 5 feet of a creature that it is not grappling at the end of this movement  it can make a bite attack against that creature with advantage.
