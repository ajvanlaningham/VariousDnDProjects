### Actions
 --- 
- **Claws**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the glass gator can't attack a different target.

- **Constrict**: One creature that's already grappled by the glass gator takes 7 (2d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, or half as much poison damage with a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Silt Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**: After taking damage while in water, the glass gator thrashes to stir up a 10-foot-radius cloud of silt around itself. The area inside the sphere is heavily obscured for 1 minute (10 rounds) in still water or 5 (2d4) rounds in a strong current. After stirring up the silt, the glass gator can move its speed.
