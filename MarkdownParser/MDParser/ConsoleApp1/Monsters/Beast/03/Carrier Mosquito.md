### Abilities
 --- 
- **Charge**: If the carrier mosquito moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with an impaling proboscis attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 5 (1d10) piercing damage.

- **Disruptive Droning**: While a carrier mosquito is in flight, it produces a constant, loud droning, forcing those nearby to shout in order to be heard. A spellcaster within 30 feet of the mosquito must succeed on a DC 10 spellcasting ability check to cast a spell with a verbal component. In addition, a creature that is concentrating on a spell and that starts its turn within 30 feet of the mosquito must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on the spell.
