- **Plant Camouflage**: The sasquatch has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes in any terrain with ample obscuring plant life.

- **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**: If the sasquatch takes 25 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hp, it is reduced to 1 hp instead.

### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The sasquatch makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its fists.

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

- **Fist**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

- **Rock**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

- **Vanishing Tantrum (Recharge 5-6)**: The sasquatch roars and stomps, kicking up debris and leaving deep footprints in the ground. Each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The sasquatch can then move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks and take the Hide action as a bonus action.
