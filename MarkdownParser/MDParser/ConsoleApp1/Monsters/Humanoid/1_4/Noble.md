### Actions
 --- 
- **Rapier**: Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Parry**: If the noble is wielding a melee weapon and can see their attacker, they add 2 to their AC against one melee attack that would hit them.

- **Nobles were raised to wealth**: A noble is trained in swordsmanship, but their greatest defense is their entourage of armed protectors.

- **In non-feudal societies**: Nobles are primarily noncombatants: the knight or veteran stat block better represents an aristocrat with extensive military experience.
