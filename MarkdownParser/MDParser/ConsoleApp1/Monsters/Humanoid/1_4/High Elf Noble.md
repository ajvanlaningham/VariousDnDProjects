### Reactions
 --- 
- **Parry**: If the noble is wielding a melee weapon and can see their attacker, they add 2 to their AC against one melee attack that would hit them.

- **High elf nobles pride themselves on the cultural accomplishments of their waning or extinct empires**: Highly educated, many high elf nobles see themselves as peacemakers, leaders, or preservers of ancient traditions.
