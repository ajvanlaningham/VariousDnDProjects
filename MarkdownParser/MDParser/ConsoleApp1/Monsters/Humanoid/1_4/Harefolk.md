- **Shapechanger Sensitivity**: The harefolk has advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine if a creature is a shapechanger. It automatically succeeds when the shapechanger is a werewolf. In addition, the harefolk has advantage on its first attack roll each turn against a creature with the Shapechanger trait or Change Shape action, regardless of whether the harefolk was previously aware of the shapechanger’s nature.
