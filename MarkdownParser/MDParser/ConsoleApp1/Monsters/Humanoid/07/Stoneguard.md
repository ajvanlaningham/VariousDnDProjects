- **Granite Maul**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the attack hits, the stoneguard may also immediately cast _thunderwave_ as a bonus action. This casting uses a spell slot, but no material components.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Sentinel**: When a creature within 5 feet of the stoneguard attacks a target other than the stoneguard, it can make a single attack roll against the attacker.

- **Skin to Stone**: When the stoneguard is attacked, it may gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks until the end of the attackerâ€™s turn.
