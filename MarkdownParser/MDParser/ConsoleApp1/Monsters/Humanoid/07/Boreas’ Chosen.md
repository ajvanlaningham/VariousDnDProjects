### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: Boreas’ chosen makes two ice spear attacks.

- **Spear**: Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.

- **Breath of the North Wind**: (Recharge 5-6). Boreas’ chosen exhales freezing breath in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) cold damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and its speed isn’t reduced. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is petrified in ice until the end of its next turn instead.
