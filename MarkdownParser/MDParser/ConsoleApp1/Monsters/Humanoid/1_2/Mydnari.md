### Abilities
 --- 
- **Bound in Jelly**: The mydnari and its jelly are wholly reliant on each other. If the mydnariâ€™s jelly is somehow separated from its master, the jelly dies within 1 minute. If the mydnari is separated from its jelly, it loses its blindsight, Acid Glob action, and Jelly Symbiosis trait.

- **Jelly Symbiosis**: A creature that touches the mydnari or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage.

- **Ooze Empathy**: A mydnari can use its Animal Handling skill on ooze-type creatures with an Intelligence score of 5 or lower. An ooze never attacks a mydnari unless provoked.
