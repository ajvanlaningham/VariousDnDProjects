### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The city watch captain makes two rapier attacks and one dagger attack. The captain can substitute a disarming attack for one rapier attack.

- **Rapier**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

- **Dagger**: Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

- **Light Crossbow**: Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

- **Disarming Attack**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop one item it's holding of the city watch captain's choice. The item lands up to 10 feet from the target, in a spot selected by the captain.

- **Orders to Attack (1/Day)**: Each creature of the city watch captain's choice that is within 30 feet of it and can hear it makes one melee or ranged weapon attack as a reaction. This person could easily have been on the other side of the law, but he likes the way he looks in the city watch uniform-and the way city residents look at him when he walks down the street leading a patrol. With a long mustache and a jaunty cap, there's no denying that he cuts a rakishly handsome figure. While a trained investigator, the city watch captain is not afraid to draw his blade to end a threat to his city.
