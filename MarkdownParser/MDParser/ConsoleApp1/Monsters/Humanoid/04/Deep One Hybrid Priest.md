### Abilities
 --- 
- **Amphibious**: A deep one priest can breathe air or water with equal ease.

- **Frenzied Rage**: On its next turn after a deep one hybrid priest takes 10 or more damage from a single attack, it has advantage on its melee attacks and adds +4 to spell and claws damage.

- **Innate Spellcasting**: the deep one priest's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

at will: sacred flame, shocking grasp

3/day each: inflict wounds, sanctuary, sleep

1/day each: ice storm, shatter

- **Lightless Depths**: A deep one hybrid priest is immune to the pressure effects of the deep ocean.

- **Ocean Change**: A deep one born to a human family resembles a human child, but transforms into an adult deep one between the ages of 16 and 30.

- **Voice of the Deeps**: A deep one priest may sway an audience of listeners with its rolling, droning speech, fascinating them for 5 minutes and making them dismiss or forget what they've seen recently unless they make a successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw at the end of that period. If the saving throw succeeds, they remember whatever events the deep one sought to erase.
