- **Innate Spellcasting**: the deep one archimandrite's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

- **Lightless Depths**: A deep one hybrid priest is immune to the pressure effects of the deep ocean.

- **Voice of the Archimandrite**: With a ringing shout, the deep one archimandrite summons all deep ones within a mile to come to his aid. This is not a spell but a command that ocean creatures and deep ones heed willingly.
