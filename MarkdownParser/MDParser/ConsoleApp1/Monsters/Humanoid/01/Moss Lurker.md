### Abilities
 --- 
- **Camouflage**: A moss lurker has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in forested or swampy terrain.

- **Love of Heavy Weapons**: While moss lurkers can use heavy weapons, they have disadvantage while wielding them.

- **Keen Hearing and Smell**: The moss lurker has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

- **Poisoned Gifts**: A moss lurker can contaminate liquids or food with poison. Someone who consumes the contaminated substance must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. When the poison is introduced, the moss lurker can choose a poison that also causes the victim to fall unconscious, or to become paralyzed while poisoned in this way. An unconscious creature wakes if it takes damage, or if a creature uses an action to shake it awake.
