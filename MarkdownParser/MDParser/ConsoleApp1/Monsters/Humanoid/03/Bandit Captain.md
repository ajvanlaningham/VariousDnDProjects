### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The bandit captain attacks twice with their scimitar and once with their dagger  or throws two daggers.

- **Scimitar**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

- **Dagger**: Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit  reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 feet  one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Parry**: If the bandit captain is wielding a melee weapon and can see their attacker, they add 2 to their AC against one melee attack that would hit them.

- **Bandits are outlaws who live by violence**: Most are highway robbers, though a few are principled exiles or freedom fighters.
