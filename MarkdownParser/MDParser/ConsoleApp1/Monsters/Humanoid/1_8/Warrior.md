- **Warriors are combatants who fight in light armor**: They excel in hit-and-run raids as opposed to pitched battles. Often  warriors are not full-time soldiers. Among tribal and nomadic groups  every able-bodied hunter or herder might be expected to fight in defense of the group. In agricultural societies  farmers might band together in warrior militias.
