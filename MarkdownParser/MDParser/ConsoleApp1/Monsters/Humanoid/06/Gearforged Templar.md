- **Glaive**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage.

- **Javelin**: Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage.

- **Whirlwind (recharge 5-6)**: The gearforged templar whirls its glaive in a great arc. Every creature within 10 feet of the gearforged takes 16 (3d10) slashing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Parry**: The gearforged templar raises its AC by 3 against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the gearforged must be able to see the attacker and must be wielding a melee weapon.
