### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The knight attacks twice with their greatsword.

- **Greatsword**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 5 (2d8) radiant damage.

- **Lance (Mounted Only)**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit  reach 10 ft.  one target. Hit: 9 (1d12 + 3) piercing damage. If the knight moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack  they deal an extra 13 (2d12) piercing damage  and the target makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure. This attack is made at disadvantage against targets within 5 feet.

- **Lay On Hands (1/Day)**: The knight touches a willing creature or themself and restores 30 hit points.

- **Knightly Inspiration (1/Day)**: The knight inspires creatures of their choice within 30 feet that can hear and understand them. For the next minute  inspired creatures gain an expertise die (1d4) on attack rolls and saving throws. A creature can benefit from only one Knightly Inspiration at a time  and the knight cannot target themselves.

- **Holy knights are dedicated to a sacred temple or a righteous principle**: While they obey the mandates of the monarchs they serve  they are sworn to fight evil wherever they find it.
