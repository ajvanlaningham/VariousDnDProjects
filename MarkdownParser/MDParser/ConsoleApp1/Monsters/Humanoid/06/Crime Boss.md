### Actions
 --- 
- **Multiattack**: The boss attacks three times with their shortsword.

- **Shortsword**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

- **Dagger**: Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit  reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft.  one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

- **Mark for Death**: The boss targets a creature within 30 feet that can see or hear them. For 1 minute or until the boss threatens a different target  the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage whenever the boss hits it with a weapon attack.

### Reactions
 --- 
- **Command Bodyguard**: When the boss would be hit by an attack, they command an ally within 5 feet to use its reaction to switch places with the boss. The ally is hit by the attack instead of the boss.

- **Offhand Dagger**: When missed by an attack, the boss makes a dagger attack.

- **A crime boss has risen to the top of a criminal gang or guild**: Theyre tough in a fight but too smart to do their own dirty work unless absolutely necessary.
