- **Bite (Medium or Large Beast Form Only)**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit  reach 5 ft  one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.

- **Beast Form**: The druid magically transforms into a Large or smaller beast or back into their true form. While in beast form  they retain their game statistics can't cast spells  and can't speak. The druids Speed increases by 10 feet  and when appropriate to their beast form they gain climb  fly  or swim speeds of 40 feet. Any equipment the druid is wearing or wielding merges into their new form.

- **Produce Flame (Cantrip; V, S)**: Ranged Spell Attack: +4 to hit  range 30 ft  one target. Hit: 4 (1d8) fire damage.

- **Entangle (1st-Level; V, S, Concentration)**: Vines erupt in a 20-foot square centered on a spot on the ground within 120 feet. The area is difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature in the area when the spell is cast makes a DC 12 Strength saving throw. On a failure  it is restrained by vines. A creature restrained in this way can use its action to make a Strength check (DC 12)  freeing itself on a success.

- **Thunderwave (1st-Level; V, S)**: Thunder rolls from the druid in a 15-foot cube. Each creature in the area makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure  a creature takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet from the druid. On a success  a creature takes half damage and is not pushed.

- **Some druids live in the wilderness with only the beasts and trees for companions**: Others serve as spiritual leaders for nomads or farmers  healing the sick and praying for fortunate weather.
